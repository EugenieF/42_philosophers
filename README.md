The *Philosophers* project aims to learn the basics of threading a process.

üìù *Subject : Creating a docker-based WordPress LEMP stack using docker-compose on Alpine Linux or Debian Buster.
The whole project has to be done in our personal virtual machine.*

*Subject bonus : 
‚Ä¢ All the forks are put in the middle of the table.
‚Ä¢ They have no states in memory but the number of available forks is represented by
a semaphore.
‚Ä¢ Each philosopher should be a process. But the main process should not be a
philosopher.*
